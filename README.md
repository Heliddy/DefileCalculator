# DefileCalculator
To get the best result of a certain board condition after casting Defile in Hearthstone

The main method is in Defile.java

This is my first time to write something, so it might be kind of hard to read.

  PS: Actually I did not make any encapsulations because I wrote it to practise some basic knowledge and use it personally.
  Those threads were the result of some FAILD tests, just ignore. Anyway I don't want to write so much thing again.
